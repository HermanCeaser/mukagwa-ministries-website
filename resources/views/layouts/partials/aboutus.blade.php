                        <p>Mukagwa Children and Women Ministries is a Christian Non Government Organization. It was
                            founded in 2018 with an aim of providing holistic education, health care, evangelism and
                            leadership to the less privileged communities.</p>
                        <p>We are people who know that we can't afford to lose an individual to illiteracy, disease and
                            spiritual poverty. We believe that when an individual is healthy, educated and spiritually
                            grown every one wins.</p>
